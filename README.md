## Find me a Skate!

### Objective and Proposal
2022 Beijing Winter Olympics is just around the corner! Figure skating is one of the popular winter 
sports in the Olympics. To win the game, skaters usually prefer to train under renowned coaches and club. Not only fully fledged environment is necessary, suitable skating boots are also crucial for skaters as it can make or break the performance. Moreover, wearing wrong boots in a long term of training may leads to prehallux syndrome. However, it is not easy to find fitting boots 
among all sorts of brands. To reduce such time consuming job, I have decided to develop a brand 
recommendation for skaters as each brand aims different feet shape.
